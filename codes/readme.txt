There are two possibilities to run the test:

a) From the command-line using

   python milestone3_test.py

b) From the Python shell (e.g. ipython).
   In this case, you have to call the function
   milestone3_test() in the module milestone3_test.
   If you want to use the test with non-default
   parameters, you have to use this method.

The zip-file you downloaded also includes a
subsampling from the *training dataset*. It is just
for you, to experiment with it. We will run the test
on our testing data after you handed in your solutions.

Also, there is a dummy predictor included in the zip-file.
It just assigns each question a random category. You
will have to replace this predictor with your own one.
