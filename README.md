# Sentence-classification-on-hierarchical-category


The task of this project is to perform automatic text categorization on questions(SMS, short text).
Including perform and evaluate some feature extraction methods. The methods used for feature extraction
include tokenization, stemming, spell correction, bag of words, TFIDF. For dimensional reduction the X 2
statistic was used. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naive Bayesian in Scikit-learn, and
Convolution neural networks were performed. And final model was make use of average rule to combine
the best 4 classifiers to increase the robustness and generalization score.

See the reports for more details.
